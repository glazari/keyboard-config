# Creating new Firmare from configs

This project for zmk firmare configs. There are github actions that help us create the firmare from that configs.

To create a new firmare simply push the changes to the project.

# Flashing firmware (WIP, did not fully test this proceedure)

Following the ZMK setup it should be just a matter of downloading the firmare and copying it to the device.

- double click the restart button on keyboard to put into boot mode.
- Should show up on OS as USB
- Copy the firmare file to the keyboard (each file to the correct side)
